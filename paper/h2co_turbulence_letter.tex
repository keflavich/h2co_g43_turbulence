\section{Introduction}
Nearly all gas in the interstellar medium is supersonically turbulent.  The
properties of this turbulence, most importantly the shape of the density
probability distribution function (\rhoPDF), are essential for determining how star
formation progresses.
There are now predictive theories of star formation that include formulations
of the Initial Mass Function \citep[IMF;][]{Padoan2002a, Padoan2007a, Hennebelle2008a, Hennebelle2009a, Chabrier2010a, 
Elmegreen2011a, Hopkins2012b, Hennebelle2013a} and the star
formation rate
\citep[SFR;][]{Krumholz2005c,  Hennebelle2011a,
Padoan2011b, Krumholz2012b, Federrath2012a, Padoan2012a}.
The distribution of stellar masses and the overall star formation rate depend
critically on the \rhoPDF established by turbulence.  It is therefore essential to
measure the \rhoPDF in the molecular clouds that produce stars.
% Moreover, measuring the actual density of a molecular cloud is crucial, because
% the mass and gravitational energy are directly proportional to the mean density
% of the cloud, which in turn determine the virial parameter and thus the ability
% of a cloud to form low- and potentially high-mass stars.

Recent works have used simulations to characterize the density distribution
from different driving modes of turbulence
\citep{Federrath2008a,Federrath2009a,Federrath2010a,Federrath2011a,Price2011b,Federrath2013a}.
These studies determined that there is a relation between the mode of turbulent driving and the width
of the lognormal density distribution, with the lognormal width $\sigma_{s}^2 = \ln\left(1+b^2
\mathcal{M}^2 \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$, where $\beta=2 (\mathcal{M}_A /
\mathcal{M})^2 = 2 (c_s/v_A)^2$ with sound speed $c_s$ and Alfven speed $v_A$,
and the logarithmic density contrast $s\equiv\ln(\rho/\rho_0)$ 
\citep[the $s$ in $c_s$ is unrelated; ][]{Padoan2011b,Molina2012a}.

The parameter $b$ describes the coupling between the density contrast and the
Mach number \citep{Federrath2008a,Federrath2010a}.  A conceptual justification
for the parameter is that for solenoidal (curly) driving, only 1 of the 3
available spatial directions is directly compressed (a longitudinal wave) and
thus $b=1/3$. Under compressive (convergent or divergent) driving, the gas is
compressed in all three spatial directions, which gives $b=3/3=1$.
\citet{Federrath2008a} and \citet{Federrath2010a} showed that simulations
driven with these modes achieve $b$ values consistent with this interpretation.

% , with the lognormal width $\sigma_{s}^2 = \ln\left(1+b^2
% \mathcal{M}^2 \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$, where $\beta=2 (\mathcal{M}_A /
% \mathcal{M})^2 = 2 (c_s/v_A)^2$ with sound speed $c_s$ and Alfven speed $v_A$,
% and the logarithmic density contrast $s\equiv\ln(\rho/\rho_0)$
% This equation can also be expressed in terms of the compressive Mach number
% $\mathcal{M}_c = b \mathcal{M}$, with $b\approx 1/3$ corresponding to
% solenoidal forcing and $b = 1$ corresponding to purely compressive forcing
% \citep{Federrath2010a,Konstandin2012a}.
%However, \citet{Hopkins2013a} notes
%that the lognormal approximation of the turbulent density distribution

All of the above turbulence-based theories of star formation explicitly assume a
lognormal form for the density probability distribution $P_V(s)$ of the gas. %, with $s\equiv\ln (\rho/\rho_0)$.
However, recent simulations \citep{Kritsuk2007a, Schmidt2009a, Federrath2010a, Federrath2013a, Federrath2013b} and theoretical work
\citep{Hopkins2013a} have shown that the assumption of a
lognormal distribution is often very poor; theoretical intermittent distributions and 
simulated \rhoPDF s deviate from lognormal by orders of magnitude
at the extreme ends of the density distributions.  Since these theories all involve
an integral over the density probability distribution function (PDF), deviation from
the lognormal distribution can drastically affect the overall predicted star formation
rate \citep[e.g.][]{Cho2011a,Collins2012a} and initial mass function.
Note that the modifications to the \rhoPDF driven by gravitational collapse
are unlikely to change the SFR or the IMF since gravitational overdensities have already
separated from the turbulent flow that created them
\citep{Klessen2000a,Kritsuk2011a,Federrath2012a,Federrath2013a}. It is therefore crucial that
studies of turbulence focus on clouds that are not yet dominated by
gravitational collapse (such as the cloud selected for this study) in order to study the initial conditions of star formation.

While simulations are powerful probes of wide ranges of parameter space, no
simulation is capable of including all of the physical processes and spatial
scales relevant to turbulence and star formation.  Observations are required to provide additional
constraints on properties of interstellar turbulence and guide simulators
toward the most useful conditions and processes to include.
\citet{Brunt2010c}, \citet{Kainulainen2012a} and \citet{Kainulainen2013a}
provide some of the first observational constraints on the mode of turbulent
driving using extinction-derived column density distributions.
They measure the parameter $b\approx0.4-0.5$, indicating that there is a `natural' mix of solenoidal
and compressive modes.  A `natural' mixture (a 2:1 mixture) of solenoidal and
compressive modes injected by the turbulent driver, i.e., a forcing ratio
$F_{comp}/F_{sol} = 1/2$, yields $b\sim0.4$. Thus, $b>0.4$ implies an enhanced
compressive forcing component relative to the naturally mixed case \citep[see
Figure 8 in][]{Federrath2010a}.
% However, these observations still attempted to characterize a lognormal
% distribution.


Formaldehyde, \formaldehyde, is a unique probe of density in molecular clouds.
Like CO, it is ubiquitous, with a nearly constant abundance wherever CO is
found \citep{Mangum1993a,Tang2013a}.  The lowest excitation transitions of
\ortho at 2 and 6 cm can be observed in absorption against the cosmic microwave
background or any bright continuum source \citep{Ginsburg2011a,Darling2012b}.
The ratio of these lines is strongly sensitive to the local density of \hh, but
it is relatively insensitive to the local gas temperature
\citep{Troscompt2009a,Wiesenfeld2013a}.  The \formaldehyde line ratio has a
direct dependence on the density that is nearly independent of the column
density.  This feature is unlike typical methods of molecular-line based density
inference in which the density is inferred to be greater than the critical density
of the detected transition.

However, the particular property of the \formaldehyde densitometer we exploit
here is its ability to trace the \emph{mass-weighted} density of the gas.
Typical density measurements from \thirteenco or dust measure the total mass
and assume a line-of-sight geometry, measuring a \emph{volume-weighted}
density, i.e. $\meanrho_V = M_{tot}/V_{tot}$.  In contrast, the \formaldehyde
densitometer is sensitive to the density at which most mass resides.
% - i.e. $<\rho>_M = \int M \rho(M) d M / M_{tot}$\todo{check this}.  
The volume- and mass- weighted densities have different dependencies on the
underlying density distributions, so in clouds dominated by turbulence, if we
have measurements of both, we can constrain the shape of the \rhoPDF and
potentially the driving mode.
% TODO: Christoph had questions about this.  "We should be more precise here.
% Can you elaborate a bit on what you do when you compare rho_V with rho_M to
% get the mode mixture of the driver? Also, note that we cannot really get the
% driver (e.g., supernova, jets, callapse, HII region, ...), but only the mode
% mixture that this driver corresponds to (or excites), i.e., we can possibly
% get the b parameter, but not the phyiscal source of the turbulence (the
% actual driver)."

In \citet{Ginsburg2011a}, we noted that the \formaldehyde densitometer revealed
\hh densities much higher than expected given the cloud-average densities from
\thirteenco observations.  The densities were too high to be explained by a
lognormal density distribution consistent with that seen in local clouds.
However, this argument was made on the basis of a statistical comparison of
``cloud-average'' versus \formaldehyde-derived density measurements and left open
the possibility that we had selected especially dense clouds.  In this paper,
we use the example of a single cloud to demonstrate that the high \formaldehyde
densities must be caused by the shape of the density distribution and to infer the
shape of this distribution.

% A brief note on notation: Throughout this paper, we use the symbol $\rho$ to
% refer to the number density of \hh.  $\meanrho_V$ and $\meanrho_M$ are used to indicate
% volume-weighted and mass-weighted mean number densities, respectively.

Section \ref{sec:observations} is a discussion of the observations used and the
cloud selected  for this study.  Section  \ref{sec:modeling} discusses the
\formaldehyde line and the tools used to model it.  Section
\ref{sec:turbulenceh2co} discusses the effect of turbulence on the \formaldehyde
lines and the constraints our observations place on the gas density
distribution.


\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}
We report \formaldehyde observations performed at the Arecibo Radio
Observatory\footnote{The Arecibo Observatory is part of the National Astronomy
and Ionosphere Center, which is operated by Cornell University under a
cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.  } and the Green
Bank Telescope (GBT)\footnote{ The National Radio Astronomy Observatory operates the
GBT and VLA and is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under
cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.  } that have been 
described in more detail in \citet{Ginsburg2011a}, with additional data to be
published in a future work.  Arecibo and
the GBT have FWHM $\approx50$\arcsec\ beams at the observed frequencies of
4.829 and 14.488 GHz respectively.  Observations were carried out in a single
pointing position-switched mode with 3 and 5.5\arcmin\ offsets for the Arecibo
and GBT observations respectively; no absorption was found in the off position
of the observations described here.  The data were taken at 0.25 \kms
resolution with 150 second on-source integrations for both lines.  The continuum
calibration uncertainty is $\sim 10\%$.

The Boston University / Five-College Radio Astronomy Observatory Galactic Ring
Survey (GRS) \thirteenco data was also used.  The GRS \citep{Jackson2006a}
is a survey of the Galactic plane in the \thirteenco\ 1-0 line with $\sim
46\arcsec$ resolution.  We used reduced data cubes of the $\ell=43$ region.

\subsection{\GRSMC A non-star-forming molecular cloud}

% In order to detect low-column-density clouds, we must use bright background
% illumination sources at 2 and 6 cm, i.e. HII regions.  There are a few dozen of
% these within the inner Galactic plane, including the sources observed in
% \citet{Ginsburg2011a} and the majority of the bright sources in the BGPS
% \citep{Ginsburg2013b}.


We examine the line of sight toward \north, also known as W49A.  In a large
survey, we observed two lines of sight toward W49, the second at \south.  Both
are very bright radio continuum sources, and two foreground GMCs are easily
detected in both \formaldehyde absorption and \thirteenco emission.  Figure
\ref{fig:w49fullspec} shows the spectrum dominated by W49 itself, but with
clear \formaldehyde foreground absorption components.  The continuum levels
subtracted from the spectra are 73 K at 6 cm and 11 K at 2 cm for the south
component (\south), and 194 K at 6 cm and 28 K at 2 cm for the north component
(\north).

We focus on the ``foreground'' line at $\sim40$ \kms, since it is not
associated with the extremely massive W49 region, which is dominated by gravity
and stellar feedback rather than pure turbulence.  The cloud is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:40kmscloud}.  
% The cloud, known as GRSMC 43.30-0.33 \citep{Simon2001a},
% was confirmed to have no associated star formation in that work.  
Additional \formaldehyde spectra of surrounding sources that are both bright at
8--1100 \um and within the \thirteenco contours of the cloud have \formaldehyde
\twotwo detections at $\sim 10$ or $\sim 60$ \kms. The detections of dense gas
at these other velocities, and corresponding nondetections of \twotwo at 40
\kms, indicate that the star-forming clumps are not associated with the 40 \kms
cloud.  

The \formaldehyde lines are observed in the outskirts of the cloud, not at
the peak of the \thirteenco emission.  The cloud spans $\sim0.6\degrees$, or
$\sim30$ pc at $D=2.8$ kpc \citep{Roman-Duval2009a}.  It is detected in \oneone
absorption at all 6 locations observed in \formaldehyde (Figure
\ref{fig:40kmscloud}), but \twotwo is only detected in front of the W49 HII
region because of the higher signal-to-noise at that location.  The detected
\thirteenco and \formaldehyde lines are fairly narrow, with \formaldehyde FWHM
ranging from $\Delta v \sim1.3-2.8$ \kms and \thirteenco widths from $\Delta v
\sim1.5-4.6$ \kms, where the largest line-widths are from averaging over the
largest scales in the cloud.  The \thirteenco lines are 50--100\% wider than the
\formaldehyde lines.

The highest \thirteenco contours are observed as a modest infrared dark cloud
in Spitzer 8 \um images, but no dust emission peaks are observed at 500 \um
\citep[Herschel;][]{Traficante2011a} or 1.1 mm
\citep[Bolocam;][]{Aguirre2011a,Ginsburg2013b} associated with the dark gas.
This is an indication that the cloud is not dominated by gravity -- no
massive dense clumps are present within this cloud.

The cloud's density is the key parameter we aim to measure, so we first determine the cloud-averaged
properties based on \thirteenco 1-0.
The cloud has mass in the range $M_{CO} = 1-3\ee{4}$ \msun in a radius $r=15$ pc as measured
from the integrated \thirteenco map using an optical depth estimate and
abundance from \citet{Roman-Duval2010a}, so its mean density is $\rho(\hh) \approx
10-30$ \percc assuming spherical symmetry (see Appendix \ref{sec:caveats}).  If we
instead assume a cubic volume, as is done in simulations, the mean density is lower by a factor $\pi/6$. 
\citet{Simon2001a} report a mass $M_{CO} = 6\ee{4} \msun$ and $r=13$ pc,
yielding a density $\rho(\hh)=100$ \percc, which is consistent with our estimates.
\citet{Roman-Duval2010a} break the cloud apart into 3 separate objects for their
analysis, GRSMC 43.04-0.11, GRSMC 43.24-00.31, and GRSMC 43.14-0.36.  All three
have the same velocity to within 1 \kms, but they show slight discontinuities
in position-velocity space.  These discontinuities are morphologically consistent
with gaps seen in turbulent simulations, validating our assessment of the cloud as a
single object, but as a maximally conservative estimate we use the density of the
northmost ``clump'' GRSMC 43.04-0.11, which overlaps our target line of sight,
as an upper limit.  It has density $\rho\approx120~\percc$, but we use $\rho<200$ \percc
as a slightly more conservative limit to allow for modest uncertainties in
optical depth, radius, and abundance.

%which are each assumed to have lower mass, much smaller radii, and therefore
%higher densities.  Figure \ref{fig:40kmscloud} shows that they are indeed members

\section{Modeling \formaldehyde}
\label{sec:modeling}
In order to infer densities using the \formaldehyde densitometer, we use the
low-temperature collision rates given by \citet{Troscompt2009a} with RADEX
using the large velocity gradient (LVG) approximation \citep{van-der-Tak2007a} to build a grid of
predicted line properties covering 100 densities $\rho(\hh) = 10-10^8$ \percc,
10 temperatures $T=5-50$ K, 100 column densities $N(\ortho) = 10^{11}-10^{16}$
\persc, and 10 \hh ortho-to-para ratios $OPR = 0.001-3.0$.

The \formaldehyde densitometer measurements are shown in Figure \ref{fig:h2codensg43}.
The figures show optical depth spectra, given by the equation
\begin{equation}
    \tau = -\ln\left(\frac{S_\nu + 2.73\mathrm{~K}}{\bar{C_\nu} + 2.73\mathrm{~K}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $S_\nu$ is the spectrum (with both the line and continuum included) and $\bar{C_\nu}$ is
the measured continuum, both in Kelvin.  The cosmic microwave background
temperature is added to the continuum since \formaldehyde can be seen in
absorption against it, though toward W49 it is negligible.


Since the W49 lines of sight are clearly on the outskirts of the foreground
cloud, not through its center, it is unlikely that these lines of sight
correspond to a centrally condensed density peak (e.g., a core).  The
comparable line ratios observed through two different lines of sight separated
by $\sim 1$ pc supports this claim, since if either line was centered on a

% We performed line fits to both lines simultaneously using a Markov-chain

% ratios OPR>1.  While these are fairly precise measurements of gas density, we
% now need to examine exactly what gas we have measured the density of.

We performed fits of the optical depth spectra to each line independently using
a  Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach \citep{Ginsburg2011c,Patil2010a}. In
both lines of sight, we found that the centroids and widths agreed (see Table
\ref{tab:obs}).  %The ratio of the line integrals is used for further analysis

From this point on, we discuss only the \north line of sight, since it is
well-fit by a single component and has high signal-to-noise.  Since both lines
of sight sample the same CO cloud, all of the measurements below are most
strongly constrained by the \north line of sight and the \south line of sight
provides no additional information.

% density $n\approx 400$ \percc \citep[for cloud
% GRSMC\_G043.04-00.11;][]{Roman-Duval2010a}, with
% $n_{\formaldehyde}/n_{\thirteenco} \approx 50$.  The discrepancy is worse using
% the \citet{Simon2001a} cloud-averaged density $n\approx 100$ \percc.

% Our density measurements are about 4$\times$ higher than CO/CI LVG density
% measurements from \citet{Plume2004a}, though those measurements rely on
% uncertain abundances and are fairly sensitive to temperature.


% Using
% Figure 4 of \citet{Ginsburg2011a}, we can `turbulence-correct' the density
% measurements, but even in the most extreme case with a turbulent density
% distribution lognormal width $\sigma_s = 1.5$, the correction is only a factor
% of 2.5, reducing the discrepancy to a factor of $\sim20$.

% We should then ask, if there is gas at high density, how much is at this density?
% To address this question, we'll assume that the densities in all of the \formaldehyde
% lines of sight in the cloud are the same, and compare the \thirteenco and
% \formaldehyde derived column densities.  The \oneone line robustly reflects the
% total \formaldehyde column, even though it does not constrain the density
% without a corresponding \twotwo detection.

% Comparing the integrated \formaldehyde lines to the integrated \thirteenco
% lines, the integrated \formaldehyde column densities are
% $N_{\ortho} = 2.03\ee{12} $ and $1.56\ee{12}$ \persc for G43.16
% and G43.17 respectively.
% The \thirteenco integrated spectra have brightness $T_{MB} = 2.6$ K and $1.3$ K
% for G43.16 and G43.17 respectively.  Using the cloud-averaged excitation
% temperature for this cloud, $\tau_{13}=2.3$ and $0.6$ respectively, so
% \citet{Roman-Duval2010a} equation 3 yields column densities $N_{13} = 6.2\ee{15}
% $ and $1.6\ee{15}$ \percc respectively.  Assuming a \thirteenco abundance relative to \hh,
% $X_{13} = 1.8\ee{-6}$ \citep[consistent with ][]{Roman-Duval2010a}, the
% resulting \hh column densities are 3.5\ee{21} and 9.0 \ee{20} \percc
% respectively.  The abundances of \ortho relative to \thirteenco are 3.2\ee{-4}
% and 9.8\ee{-4} respectively, or relative to \hh, 5.8\ee{-10} and 1.7\ee{-9},
% which are entirely consistent with other measurements of $X_{\ortho}$.  
%These
%are relatively modest column densities, with $A_V=17$ and 4.5;
%these measurements are consistent with \citet{Plume2004a} if the different
%A_V/N(H_2) conversions are corrected.

% These measurements for a specific cloud validate the statistical argument made
% in \citet{Ginsburg2011a}.  

% However, upon closer inspection of the cloud
% morphology, the real explanation may be simple: the filling factor of gas
% within the GMC is small on large scales, not local scales.  The implied volume
% filling factor from this analysis and the \citet{Ginsburg2011a} analysis is
% $\sim10^{-2}$; the assumption of spherical symmetry is therefore extremely
% poor.  

% This low filling factor has major implications for the gas: if it is in
% gravitational collapse, the free-fall times are shorter by an order of
% magnitude than usually assumed.  The long lifetimes of GMCs therefore implies
% that the cloud cannot be undergoing gravitational collapse, but instead
% maintains a turbulent equilibrium.  \todo{Strengthen this argument...}
% 
% It also demonstrates that density-based star-formation thresholds do not
% independently predict star formation \citep{Parmentier2011a}.  Star formation
% cannot simply be driven by the free-fall time of gas, since apparently much of
% the gas above $n>10^4$ \percc is not in free-fall.

% \subsection{Comparison to 3C123 and the California Nebula}
% The radio source 3C123, an active galactic nucleus, is often used as a flux
% calibrator for radio telescopes.  We used it for that purpose in our GBT
% observations, and detected the \twotwo line.  \citet{Liszt1995a} detected the
% \oneone line with the NRAO 43m telescope.  The line ratio in front of 3C123 is
% approximately $\tau_{1-1}/\tau_{2-2} \approx 10$, which indicates a density
% $n\approx10^{3.6}$ \percc.  This density is significantly lower than in the
% W49 40 \kms cloud, but still higher than expected in an inactive GMC
% \citep[which this is][]{Harvey2013a}.

\section{Turbulence and the \formaldehyde cm lines}
\label{sec:turbulenceh2co}
Supersonic interstellar turbulence can be characterized by its driving mode,
Mach number $\mathcal{M}$, and magnetic field strength. 
We start by assuming the gas density follows a lognormal distribution, defined
as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:lognormal}
    P_V(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_s^2}} \exp\left[-\frac{(s+\sigma_s^2/2)^2}{2 \sigma_s^2}\right]
\end{equation}
\citep{Padoan2011b,Molina2012a}
where the subscript $V$ indicates that this is a volume-weighted density
distribution function.  The parameter $s$ is the logarithmic density contrast,
$s\equiv\ln(\rho/\rho_0)$ for mean volume-averaged density $\rho_0 \equiv \meanrho_V$.
The width of the turbulent density distribution
is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:sigmas}
    \sigma_s^2 = \ln\left(1+b^2 \mathcal{M}^2 \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\beta= 2 c_s^2/v_A^2 = 2 \mathcal{M}_A^2/\mathcal{M}^2$ and $b$ ranges
from $b\sim1/3$ (solenoidal, divergence-free forcing) to $b\sim1$ (compressive,
curl-free) forcing \citep{Federrath2008a,Federrath2010a}.  $c_s$ is the
isothermal sound speed ($s$ here is short for `sound'), $v_A$ is the Alfvén
speed, and $\mathcal{M}_A$ is the Alfvénic Mach number.


The observed \formaldehyde line ratio roughly depends on the \emph{mass-weighted}
probability distribution function (as opposed to the volume-weighted
distribution function, which is typically reported in simulations).  We first
examine the implications of assuming a lognormal distribution for the
mass-weighted density.
% such that $p_m(s) = \rho \cdot p_s(s)$, or
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eqn:lognormal}
%     p_m(s) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_s^2}} \exp{\left(-\frac{(\ln(\rho/\rho_0))^2}{2 \sigma_s^2}\right)}
% \end{equation}
% where we have assumed a lognormal form for $p_m(s)$.  
%Other forms of the density PDF will be addressed in Section \ref{sec:simpdfs}.

We use LVG models of the \formaldehyde lines, which are computed assuming a
fixed local density, as a starting point to model the observations of
\formaldehyde in turbulence.   Starting with a fixed \emph{volume-averaged}
density $\rho_0$, we compute the observed \formaldehyde optical depth $\tau_\nu$ in both
the \oneone and \twotwo
line by averaging over the mass-weighted density distribution, $P_M\equiv(\rho/\rho_0) P_V$.
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:tauintegral}
    \tau_{\nu}(\rho_0) &=& \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tau_{\nu,p}(\rho) P_M(\ln \rho/\rho_0) d \ln (\rho/\rho_0)\\
                       &=& \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tau_{\nu,p}(\rho_0 e^s) P_M(s) d s
\end{eqnarray} % there's too much spoo in my fleem http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/1997-04-27/
$\tau_p(\rho)$ is the optical depth \emph{per particle} at a given density, where $N_p$ is the column
density (\perkmspc) from the LVG model.
We assume a fixed abundance of \ortho relative to \hh
(i.e., the \formaldehyde perfectly traces the \hh).\footnote{While there is
building evidence that there is \hh not traced by CO
\citep{Shetty2011b,Shetty2011a}, the \formaldehyde and CO should be tracing the
same gas, as \formaldehyde abundances have typically been observed to be
consistent with CO abundances.  \formaldehyde deficiency is also most likely to
occur on the optically thin surfaces of clouds where the total gas density is
expected to be lower, so our measurements should be largely unaffected by
abundance variation within the cloud.}

Figure \ref{fig:lvgsmooth}
shows the result of this integral for an abundance of \ortho relative to \hh, 
$X(\ortho)=10^{-8.5}$, where the X-axis shows the volume-averaged number density $\rho_0 \equiv \rho(\hh)$ and the Y-axis
shows the observable optical depth ratio of the two \formaldehyde centimeter
lines.
The LVG model, which assumes a single density
(or a Dirac $\delta$ function as the density distribution), is shown along with
the PDF-weighted-average versions of the model that take into account realistic turbulent
gas distributions.  

The \formaldehyde \twotwo line requires a higher density to be ``refrigerated''
into absorption.  As a result, any spread of the density distribution means
that a higher fraction of the mass is capable of exciting the \twotwo line.
Wider distributions increase the \twotwo line more than the \oneone line and
decrease the (\oneone)/(\twotwo) ratio.  

% Abundance limits: 
% At n=24553, logc=12.38 (best fit)

% N = 2.6e14 integral(tex * tau / (1-exp(-5.3/tex)))

%which necessarily implies a higher
%column density of \ortho for the higher densities in Equation

%\ortho columns.  An example of this smoothing is shown in Figure
%\ref{fig:lvgsmooth}.

\GRSMC is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lvgsmooth} as a blue point.  The position
of this point on the x-axis is set by the \thirteenco-derived volume-averaged density,
while its y-axis position in the three subplots reflects the \formaldehyde measurements
reported in Table \ref{tab:obs}.
%Very wide distributions are required to match the observations.

Assuming the thermal dominates the magnetic pressure ($\beta>>1$), we can fit
$\sigma_s$ from the model distributions in Figure \ref{fig:lvgsmooth}.  Using two
different forms for the density distribution, and using only the $\tau$
measurements as a constraint, we derive the value of $\sigma_s$ in Table
\ref{tab:datafits} and seen in the bottom-right panel of Figure \ref{fig:lvgsmooth}.
% assuming a lognormal
% distribution, the best-fit
% $\sigma_s=2.8$, with a 95\% confidence interval $2.36 < \sigma_s < 3.49$.

Direct measurements of the Mach number from line-of-sight velocity dispersion
measurements allow for further constraints on the distribution shape.  Assuming
a temperature $T=10$ K, consistent with both the \formaldehyde and CO
observations \citep{Plume2004a}, the sound speed in molecular gas is $c_s=0.19$
\kms.  The gas is unlikely to be much colder, so this sound speed provides an
upper limit on the Mach number.  The observed line FWHM in G43.17 is 0.95 \kms
for \formaldehyde and 1.7 \kms for \thirteenco 1-0,
% \citep[although warm gas tracers have a larger linewidth, FWHM(H$_2$$^{18}$O)

so the 3-D Mach number of the turbulence is \citep{Schneider2013a}
\begin{equation}

    \mathcal{M}_{3D} \equiv 3^{1/2} \mathcal{M}_{1D} \approx \frac{3^{1/3}}{(8\ln 2)^{1/2}} FWHM / c_s 
\end{equation}
or $\mathcal{M}_{3D} = 3.8 - 6.6 $ , ranging from the \formaldehyde to the \thirteenco width along
the \north line of sight.  However, we note that the velocity dispersion for the whole cloud is
larger.

}{fig:lognormalmcmc}{1}%{0}

Using the observed range of Mach numbers along the \north line of sight, we can
constrain $b$ with Equation \ref{eqn:sigmas}.  Figure \ref{fig:lognormalmcmc} shows the Mach number-$b$
parameter space allowed by the observed volume density and \formaldehyde lines
both with and without the Mach number constraint imposed.  If we assume the Mach number
is approximately halfway between the \formaldehyde and CO based measurements, with
a dispersion that includes both, we can constrain $b>0.66$ (see Table \ref{tab:datafits}).
% In principle, we should be able to then measure the compressibility coefficient
% $b$ using our constraints on $\mathcal{M}$ and Equation \ref{eqn:sigmas}.
% However, even if we select the low end of the $\sigma_s$ values $\sigma_s=2.2$
% and the highest Mach number $\mathcal{M} = 6.6$, the $b$ values are
% unrealistic: we have measured a lower-limit $b>1.7$.  This measurement indicates
% that the lognormal density distribution is inadequate to describe the cloud.
% Since there is no allowed parameter space, the fitted parameters are left
% blank in Table \ref{tab:datafits}.
% % the allowed values of $\sigma_s$ given the line-width based limits on
% % $\mathcal{M}$ range from 1.8-2.1 for $b=1$ and 1.2-1.5 for $b=1/3$.  If
% % magnetic pressure is significant, the allowed values of $\sigma_s$ drop.

% Given that the observed mean cloud density is $n(\hh)\lesssim10^2 \percc$, Figure
% \ref{fig:lvgsmooth} shows that only the most extreme values of $\sigma_s$ can
% explain the mean density.  Even if the cloud is extremely oblate, e.g. with a
% line-of-sight axis $0.1\times$ the plane-of-sky axes, $\sigma_s > 1.5$ is
% required.

\subsubsection{The Hopkins distribution}
% This PP is OK
As one possible alternative, we use the
\citet{Hopkins2013a} density distribution with $T-\sigma_s$ and $T-\mathcal{M}_C$
relations fitted to measurements from a series of simulations
\citep{Kowal2007a,Kritsuk2007a,Schmidt2009a,Federrath2010a,Konstandin2012a,Molina2012a,Federrath2013b}, 
where $\mathcal{M}_c$ is the compressive Mach number, e.g. $\mathcal{M}_c = b \mathcal{M}$.
We use a $T$ value from 
\begin{equation} 
    \label{eqn:Tsigma}
    T(\sigma_s) = 0.25 \ln (1+0.25 \sigma_s^4 \left(1+T(\sigma_s)\right)^{-6})
\end{equation}
where $T$ is an ``intermittency'' parameter that indicates the
deviation of the distribution from lognormal\footnote{Equation \ref{eqn:Tsigma}
is a transcendental equation, so we use root-finding to determine $T$.}.  
The intermittency parameter is described in \citet{Hopkins2013a} as a unitless
parameter which increases with Mach number and is correlated with the strength
of the deviations from the mean turbulent properties as a function of time.
Its physical meaning beyond these simple correlations is as yet poorly understood.

Assuming the same abundance as above, $X(\formaldehyde)=10^{-8.5}$, the Hopkins
distribution is incompatible with our observations for the $T-\sigma$ relations considered
in \citet{Hopkins2013a} and the other $T$ values and relations explored in Figure \ref{fig:distributions}b.
Figure \ref{fig:distributions}a shows how the Hopkins
and lognormal distributions differ; the Hopkins distribution is more sharply
peaked and includes less gas above its peak density.  The incompatibility with
our observations arises because the Hopkins distribution produces lower
mass-weighted densities than the lognormal. 

However, the
Hopkins distribution is compatible with our observations if a lower abundance is assumed.
Using the Hopkins distribution with $X(\formaldehyde)=10^{-9}$, we find
$\sigma_s\sim2.5$ (see Table \ref{tab:datafits}).  This value is compatible
with the observed Mach numbers.  Using the relation 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:McMT}
    b \mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}_c  \approx 20 T
\end{equation}
from \citet{Hopkins2013a} Figure 3, we can derive a lower limit $b>0.7$.
However, there is additional intrinsic uncertainty in the coefficient in
Equation \ref{eqn:McMT} that comes from fitting the relation to simulated data,
and we have not accounted for this uncertainty.  % ($b>0.49$ at 99.9\% confidence).

The Hopkins distribution is compatible with our observations, but requires
relatively extreme values of the standard deviation and $b$ parameters.  
We explored a few alternate realizations of the Hopkins distribution's
$T-\sigma$ relation, with results shown in Figure \ref{fig:distributions}.
Independent of the form of the Hopkins distribution chosen, it is more
restrictive than the lognormal distribution.


% Using the $\sigma_s=2.5$ distribution, which is
% just barely consistent with the observations, $T=0.29$, and based on
% \citet{Hopkins2013a} Figure 3, the compressive Mach number $\mathcal{M}_c ~ 20
% T \approx 5.8$.   Compared to the Mach number restrictions from the line width,
% this $\mathcal{M}_C$ implies a compressive-to-total ratio $b > 0.6$.

\subsection{Discussion}
The restrictions on $\sigma_s$ and $b$ using either the lognormal or Hopkins density
distribution are indications that compressive forcing must be a significant, if
not dominant, mode in this molecular cloud.  However, there are no obvious
signs of cloud-cloud collision or interaction with a supernova that might
directly indicate what is driving the turbulence.
% Since magnetic fields have the
% opposite effect of compressive turbulence on the density distribution, magnetic
% fields cannot explain the observations.
% If magnetic fields are in balance with
% or dominate thermal pressure in this cloud, $\beta\gtrsim2/3$, the forcing must
% be predominantly compressive, with $b>1/3$.
% Crutcher & others seem not to have detected Zeeman splitting in this cloud

Most of the systematic uncertainties tend to require a \emph{greater} $b$
value, while we have already inferred a lower-limit
that is moderately higher than others have observed \citep{Brunt2010c,Kainulainen2013a}.
Temperatures in GMCs are typically 10-20 K, and we assumed 10 K: warmer
temperatures increase the sound speed and therefore decrease the Mach number. If
the cloud is warmer, the $b$ values again must be higher to account for the measured
$\sigma_s$.  Magnetic fields similarly have the inverse effect of $b$ on
$\sigma_s$, with decreasing $\beta$ requiring higher $b$ for the same
$\sigma_s$.

The only systematic that operates in the opposite direction is the abundance of
\ortho.  Lower abundance shifts all curves in Figure \ref{fig:lvgsmooth} up and
to the right, which decreases $\sigma_s$ and therefore allows for a lower $b$
for fixed Mach number.  However, abundances lower  than $X=10^{-9}$ are rarely
observed except in Galactic cirrus clouds \citep{Turner1989a} and highly
shocked regions like the cirumnuclear disk around Sgr A* \citep{Pauls1996a}, so
the measurements in Table \ref{tab:datafits} should bracket the allowed values.
While we only explored two possible abundances in detail, note that the
$\sigma_s$ values derived from the lognormal distribution vary little over
half-dex changes in abundance (Table \ref{tab:datafits}), indicating that this
measurement at least is robust to abundance assumptions.

We explore these caveats and others in more detail in the Appendix.

\section{Conclusions}
We demonstrate the use of a novel method of inferring parameters of the density
probability distribution function in a molecular cloud using \formaldehyde densitometry
in conjunction with \thirteenco-based estimates of total cloud mass.  We have
measured the standard deviation of the lognormal turbulence density distribution $\sigma_s
\approx 1.6$ and placed a lower limit on the compressiveness parameter $b>0.4$.
Both measurements are robust to the assumed cloud density, \formaldehyde
abundance, and other assumptions.

Our data show evidence for compressively driven turbulence in a
non-star-forming giant molecular cloud.  Since this cloud represents a typical
molecular cloud, it is likely that compressive driving is a common feature of
all molecular clouds.

This new method opens the possibility of investigating the drivers of
turbulence more directly, e.g.\ by measuring the shape of the density PDF both
within spiral arms and in the inter-arm regions.  The main requirements for
applying this technique are a moderately accurate measurement of the mean cloud
density, which can easily be provided by \thirteenco surveys such as the GRS,
and a high signal-to-noise measurement of the 2 cm and 6 cm \formaldehyde
lines.  

A precise measurement of the Mach number of the cloud will allow
\emph{measurements} of $b$ rather than the limits we have presented here.
Investigations of the predicted observed velocity dispersion and line strengths
in both \formaldehyde and \thirteenco in simulations of turbulent clouds should
provide the details needed to take this next step.

% Our data also indicate that a lognormal distribution is inadequate to describe
% the density PDF.  Instead, an intermittent distribution such as that presented
% in \citet{Hopkins2013a} is an acceptable fit to the data.

% 
% In order to simplify the application of these PDFs to the LVG models, we fit
% the asymmetric distributions with the sum of two lognormals with different

% An example demonstrating that two lognormals is a good approximation of one of the

% 
% To use these fitted two-lognormal distributions, we create new PDFs consisting

% scaled.  In Figure \ref{fig:compsmooth} [not included; see below], the reported widths for the
% ``compressive'' distributions are the widths of the wider, lower distribution
% in \ref{fig:fittedpdf}.
% 
% Upon further inspection, this approximation actually does a poor job as it
% fails to reproduce the tails, which are more important than the peak.

% \section{Data Fitting: Summary of the Bayesian approach}
% In Section \ref{sec:grsmcturb}, we performed fits to the data using a
% Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo fitting approach written in \texttt{pymc}.  The spectral line
% data were fit using standard approaches implemented in \texttt{pyspeckit}
% (\url{pyspeckit.bitbucket.org}).  The \texttt{pyspeckit} fits yielded an
% estimate of the optical depth ratio $R = \tau_{\oneone}/\tau_{\twotwo}$ with approximately
% Gaussian error bars, so the ratio $R$ was implemented as a normally distributed
% random variable.
% 
% The Mach number determinations from the \formaldehyde and CO lines disagree by
% a factor of nearly two, so we treated the Mach number as a normally distributed
% variable with $\mu=5.1$ and $\sigma=1.4$ such that an intermediate value
% between the CO ($\mathcal{M}_{3d} = 6.6$) and \formaldehyde ($\mathcal{M}_{3d}
% = 3.7$) measurement is weakly favored, but both measured values are allowed.
% The uncertainty in the Mach number also reflects the general difficulty in determining
% a Mach number from spectral line data, as noted in \citet{Schneider2013a}.
% 
% In the interest of reproducibility, the code for these models is publicly

% \section{Abundance}
% \todo{This is a summary of work in progress; it is not intended to be kept in
% the submitted document in this form.}
% In the context of the LVG model, the largest remaining uncertainty is the
% abundance.  We can take a few different approaches to minimize the effect of
% this uncertainty.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item we can assess what measurements come out of using different abundances
%  \item we can attempt to measure the abundance of H2CO relative to 13CO and use
%      that as an input to the LVG models
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% I've begun both efforts.  Using the least-squares fit of the formaldehyde model,
% the \ortho abundance relative to \thirteenco is -2.5, or relative to \hh, -8.26.
% This analysis is done using eqn. 2 and 3 from \citet{Roman-Duval2010a} by
% assuming $T_{ex}=const$ at the value reported for GRSMC 43.30-0.33.
% 
% The important question is then - what are the effects of higher abundance?
% Unfortunately, it appears that higher abundance shifts the curves a bit down
% and left in Figure \ref{fig:lvgsmooth},  implying that lower $\sigma_s$ values
% are possible, so perhaps it will be possible to accommodate lognormal.

\appendix
\section{Assumptions, caveats, and uncertainties}
\label{sec:caveats}
We explore the various caveats and assumptions that have been treated above in
more detail here.

The precise density measurements presented here are based off of large velocity
gradient approximations \citep{Sobolev1957a} for the escape probability of line
radiation from the cloud.  This method is widely used but remains an
approximation.  In the case of \formaldehyde, it has been tested with a variety
of codes \citep{van-der-Tak2007a,Henkel1983a} but is subject to uncertainties in
the velocity gradient and system geometry.  However, in the case of the
observations in this paper, the lines were observed in the optically thin regime, and the
LVG approximation should not affect our results.

The collision rates of \formaldehyde with p-\hh, o-\hh, and He are estimated
based on computer simulations of the particles.  \citet{Troscompt2009a}
improved upon the measurements of \citet{Green1991a}, bringing the typical
collision rate uncertainty down from $\sim50\%$ in the He-based approximation
to $\sim10\%$ using full models of ortho and para \hh.  \citet{Zeiger2010a}
reported the results of using modified collision rates and noted that the
errors in the \hh density were, in the worst case, $<0.3$ dex.  With the
improved \citet{Troscompt2009a} collision rates, the model uncertainties are no
longer dominated by collision rate uncertainties.

Abundance remains a serious concern, as most studies of \ortho abundance
do not observe multiple transitions and therefore do not constrain the relative
level populations.  There
are also general difficulties in measuring absolute abundance of molecules, as
the absolute column of \hh is rarely known with high accuracy.  Most abundance
measurements are above $X_{\ortho}>10^{-9}$
\citep{Dickens1999a,Liszt2006a}, 
except near Sgr A* \citep{Pauls1996a} and in Galactic cirrus clouds
\citep{Turner1989a,Turner1993a} where it is generally observed to have
$10^{-10}<X_{\ortho}<10^{-9}$.  These measurements dictated the abundance
boundaries we used in our analysis.
%which validates our
%measurements, but deeper studies of abundance are warranted, particularly
%studies of how \formaldehyde varies relative to CO in clouds.
% Liszt: -8.4
% Pauls: 5x10^-10 = -9.3
% Dickens: 1.7-6x10^-9 = -8.7 to -8.2
% Turner1989: < -9.22

The ortho-to-para ratio of \hh is a significant uncertainty in the models,
since para-\hh is more effective at ``refrigerating'' the \formaldehyde
molecules.  Values of the ortho-to-para ratio $>1$ favor lower densities by
$\sim0.3$ dex, but we have used these lower densities in our
analysis, and therefore our results are conservative.  However, if the
ortho-to-para ratio is in reality close to zero, the density PDF must be wider
and $b$ correspondingly higher.

The ``covering factor'' of foreground clouds in front of background
illumination sources is, in general, a major concern when performing absorption
measurements.  For the clouds presented in this work, the absorbing region
is much larger than the background, as evidenced by the two lines-of-sight with
similar optical depth ratios.  However, for more detailed studies of density
variations, EVLA observations can and should be employed.

The single largest uncertainty is related to the mean properties of the GMC.
While we have accounted for these uncertainties by adopting a very conservative
range of values for the mean density (covering two orders of magnitude), it is
not entirely clear how the mean density of the cloud should be computed for
comparison to simulations and the analytic distributions.  Since this is a
foreground cloud lying in front of a rich portion of the galactic plane, the
best mass estimates will always come from molecular line observations,
and therefore they are unlikely to be improved unless new wide-field CO
observations are taken, e.g. with CCAT.  

To validate our cloud mean density measurements, we have performed a dendrogram
analysis \citep{Rosolowsky2008c} on the integrated \thirteenco map of the
\GRSMC cloud.  We perform the analysis both on the large-scale $r\sim20$ pc
cloud, tracking down to 10 pc scales, and then on the individual clump that is
directly in front of W49.  We show the cloud density, computed using the
assumptions stated in the text to convert \thirteenco luminosity to mass, for
three different geometrical assumptions described in the caption of Figure
\ref{fig:dendro}.  While the clump densities are potentially higher than we
assumed in the analysis, they are probably not the appropriate numbers to
compare to the simulations we have cited, which are generally simulating entire
molecular clouds and measuring the density distribution within a large box.

for extracting the volume: squares assume spherical symmetry using the
effective radius of the contour, which is proportional to the square root of
the number of pixels.  Circles do the same, but assume that the line-of-sight
radius is 2 pc (i.e., smaller than the observed plane-of-the-sky
dimensions).  The triangles show the volume of an ellipsoid using the moments of the
