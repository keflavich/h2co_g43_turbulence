Responses to most recent comments:

1. Title - Compressive turbulence in a quiescent molecular cloud: Observations with
\formaldehyde
2. "Measuring the actual density..." I'm going to leave out that sentence
because I don't think we improve upon standard methods for measuring the *mean*
density of the cloud in this paper
3. First PP of intro has been rephrased; the "properties of the turbulence" I
had previously really refer to the  density PDF.
4. Citations on pg 1: Added, but not 100% sure my citekeys match the specific
references you pointed out.
5. Rephrased the section on gravitational collapse, including suggested citations
6. Included compressive vs solenoidal description in greater detail
7. Removed equations from the introduction (I had an incorrect one that you pointed out)

Responses to previous comments (I think I addressed these before, but I'm not 100% sure so there are some repeats):
1. Eqn 4.: I keep d ln rho instead of d ln rho/rho_0 since these are equal (d ln rho/rho0 = d ln rho - d ln rho0 = d ln rho)
