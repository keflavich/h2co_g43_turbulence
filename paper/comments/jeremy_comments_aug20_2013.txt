Added a parenthetical:

not yet dominated by gravitational collapse (such as the cloud selected for
this study) in order to study the initial conditions of star formation.  "

Added some text: Observations were carried out in a single pointing
position-switched mode with 3 and 5.5\arcmin\ offsets for the Arecibo and GBT
observations respectively; no absorption was found in the off position of the
observations described here.  The data were taken at 0.25 \kms resolution with
150 second on-source integrations for both lines.  The continuum calibration
uncertainty is $\sim 10\%$.

This was fairly confusing.  Formaldehyde is detected, but the 2-2 line is
always at 60 km/s or 6 km/s.  I've rephrased.

Yes.  It is addressed in the discussion of turbulence.

That logical jump is not possible to make for this cloud; we rely on the
assumption that the turbulence in this cloud and in star-forming clouds is the
same.  

> - p5:  why do you need to estimate a density limit based on CO?  Not clear to the reader at this point.

Added lead-in:
"The cloud's density is the key parameter we aim to measure, so we first
determine the cloud-averaged properties based on \thirteenco 1-0.  "

> Sec 3:

Added:
From this point on, we discuss only the \north line of sight, since it is
well-fit by a single component and has high signal-to-noise.  Since both lines
of sight sample the same CO cloud, all of the measurements below are most
strongly constrained by the \north line of sight and the \south line of sight
provides no additional information.

This sentence should have been excised in its entirety; you didn't miss
anything.  Thanks for catching it, though.

It is the size of the circle.  Added a note.

This is now explicitly defined & stated.

In both definitions of Eqn 3, I explicitly state that the $s$ in $c_s$ is for "sound".

A paragraph borrowing from Christoph's explanation has been added to the intro.

I don't think typical values for sigma_s are particularly well-known; in
Perseus they may have been measured to be ~0.5 once.

Hmm, actually, I would say P_V *is* unitless: P_V is a probability, after all.
The integral is not d(rho), but d(rho/rho_0), such that the integral is over a
unitless parameter.

This is an important point; when I define P_M I now appropriately divide rho/rho_0

As Christoph says, it's not trivial.  I may add another appendix with these
calculations.

I think that's what this is: a weighted average over a given distribution

weighted_x = int( x p(x) dx )

Yes, rephrased.

I have separated this into its own PP and rephrased.

I don't think I understand this question; are you asking what the meaning of
sigma_s is or what conclusions should be drawn from this particular measurement
of sigma_s?

> - How exactly did you impose the constraint on M in your second M-b plot?

This was in an earlier draft and removed, so it's good that you picked up on it.
The number is halfway between the naive 1D Mach numbers inferred from 13co and H2CO;
this has been noted.

> Tab 1:

Ratio 1-1/2-2; good idea

Added to the caption.

They overlap with each other; I'll need to find a better way to represent them.

Fair enough; changed to "averaging over..."

1. Added "13CO-derived volume-weighted density" to the caption
2. added text explicitly stating how the x/y positions are derived at the end of 4.1pp1.

Rephrased.

> - What if X = 10^-9.5?  Does this radically alter sigma_s?  How sensitive is your result to the abundance assumption?

Not radically, since Table 2 shows that sigma_s is about the same for 0.5 dex
change for the lognormal distribution.  However, I really ought to free
abundance as a parameter...  chalk that up as Future Work.

Compressive Mach number.  This is now described.

This is something I could probably do, but I'm going to put it off til I hear
similar from the referee.  You're right, though, a parameter space plot would
be more convincing.

Good idea, done.

It's a little more complicated than that - the "formaldehyde-derived density"
will never correspond to a peak in the PDF, so it will never look like a good
fit.

I think we discussed this - since we rely on having the same volume-averaged
density measurement for both lines of sight (same cloud), using both doesn't
help.
