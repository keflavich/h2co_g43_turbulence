I incorporated most of your comments directly.

On standard deviation vs line width: I replaced "width" with std. dev when
describing distributions, but kept width when it actually referred to the width
of a spectral line.

On upper vs lower limits: Thanks for catching my errors.

Regarding parentheses around eqn #'s: I'll leave that up to the Editor

Re: Figure 6 - added discussion involving this figure.  It is relatively
low-impact, so Figure 6b could be removed without much loss, but I think figure
6a is very illustrative.

b>0.4 or b>0.6?  b>0.4 is the more conservative limit that accounts for both abundance assumptions.
