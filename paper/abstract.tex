A measurement of the turbulence-driven density distribution in a
non-star-forming molecular cloud
}
\begin{abstract}
    Molecular clouds are supersonically turbulent.  This turbulence governs
    the initial mass function and the star formation rate.  In order to
    understand the details of star formation, it is therefore essential to understand
    the properties of turbulence, in particular the probability distribution of
    density in turbulent clouds.
    We present \formaldehyde volume density measurements of a non-star-forming
    cloud along the line of sight towards W49A. We use these measurements in
    conjunction with total mass estimates from \thirteenco to infer the shape of the
    density probability distribution function.  This method is complementary to
    measurements of turbulence via the column density distribution and should
    be applicable to any molecular cloud with detected CO.  We show that
    turbulence in this cloud is probably compressively driven, with a
    compressive-to-total Mach number ratio $b = \mathcal{M}_C/\mathcal{M}>0.4$.  
    We measure the standard deviation of the density distribution, 
    constraining it to the range $1.5 < \sigma_s < 1.9$
    assuming that the density is lognormally distributed.  This measurement
    represents an essential input into star formation laws.
    The method of averaging over different excitation conditions to produce a 
    model of emission from a turbulent cloud is generally applicable to optically
    thin line observations.
