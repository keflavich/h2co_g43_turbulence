\title{Compressive turbulence in a quiescent molecular cloud: Observations with
\formaldehyde}
\begin{abstract}
    Molecular clouds are supersonically turbulent.  This turbulence may govern
    the initial mass function and the star formation rate.  It is therefore
    essential to understand the properties of turbulence, in particular the
    probability distribution of density in turbulent clouds.

    We present \formaldehyde volume density measurements of a non-star-forming
    cloud along the line of sight towards W49A. We use these measurements in
    conjunction with total mass estimates from CO to infer the shape of the
    density probability distribution function.  This method is complementary to
    measurements of turbulence via the column density distribution and should
    be applicable to any molecular cloud with detected CO.  We show that
    turbulence in this cloud must be compressively driven, with a
    compressive-to-total ratio $b = \mathcal{M}_C/\mathcal{M}>0.6$, and that a
    lognormal distribution is unlikely to describe the cloud's density.
